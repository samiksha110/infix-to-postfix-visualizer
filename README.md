📘 Infix to Postfix Expression Tree Visualizer
📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based visualization tool that demonstrates the conversion of an infix expression to postfix notation using a stack, followed by the construction and visualization of an expression tree.

It is designed as a Data Structures educational project to help understand:

Stack operations

Operator precedence

Expression trees

Tree traversals

🎯 Features

✅ Infix to Postfix conversion (animated)

✅ Stack visualization (push & pop operations)

✅ Expression Tree construction from postfix

✅ Tree visualization using HTML Canvas

✅ Tree traversals:

Inorder

Preorder

Postorder

✅ Clean and responsive UI

✅ Works on desktop and mobile browsers

🧠 Concepts Used

Stack

Binary Tree

Expression Tree

Tree Traversals

Operator Precedence

Asynchronous JavaScript (for animation)

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6)

HTML Canvas

GitHub Pages (for hosting)

🧪 Sample Test Cases

Infix Expression	Postfix Expression
A+B	AB+
A+B*C	ABC*+
(A+B)*C	AB+C*
(A+B)*(C-D)	AB+CD-*
((A+B)*C)-(D/E)	AB+C*DE/-


🎓 Educational Purpose
This project was developed as part of a Data Structures course to visually demonstrate how:

Stacks are used in expression conversion

Expression trees represent arithmetic expressions

Traversals relate to different expression forms
